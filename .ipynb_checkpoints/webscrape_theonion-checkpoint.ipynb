Yeah, I\\u2019ve got enough scapegoat ideas to get me through the next four, maybe eight years.\\u201d McGuire went on to say that he wasn\\u2019t considering scapegoating Jews just yet, but would wait to see how the next few years play out.',\n",

That is surely the path to kindness, from which a nation seldom returns.\\u201d Trump went on to say that the courage Americans demonstrated today would allow future generations to one day look at the world around them with indifference or, with any luck, pure disdain.',\n",
