      "To the Editor:Re “Reince Priebus Defends Holocaust Statement That Failed to Mention Jews” (nytimes.com, Jan. 30):Of all of President Trump’s actions during his first 10 days in office, among the most egregious was the deliberate omission of Jews from his statement for International Holocaust Remembrance Day.Taking away the intent of the Holocaust may not be the classic form of Holocaust denial, but it is a form of denial nonetheless. This decision is the clearest indication that no historical fact is too big for the Trump administration to try to erase from public consciousness.And most important, it shows that this administration is controlled by people who know truth from fiction, but not right from wrong.MITCHELL TURKERPortland, Ore. \n",

      "To the Editor:Re “A Sinister Perception of Islam Now Steers the White House” (front page, Feb. 2):In Sarajevo in the 1990s, I saw my neighbors and family members gunned down by Serbian nationalist snipers. As a result, I, perhaps more than most people in the United States, where I am now a citizen, can relate to the fear and anger many feel toward terrorists. But reading this article made me fear that we are entering the dark ages, an era when Muslim registry could be next.When I, a Muslim, was a victim of a different form of terrorism, I had a choice: believe that all Orthodox Christian Serbs are bad people or that only some Serbs had engaged in war to do bad things.Americans must resist generalizations. Some terrorists are Muslims, but not all Muslims are terrorists. We Muslim Americans are afraid of terrorists, too.AMNA TOKMOFishers, Ind. \n",

      "To the Editor:Re “An Apology to Muslims” (column, Feb. 2):May I be allowed to expand on Nicholas Kristof’s apology? I would like to include Mexicans and other Latinos and Latinas, Europeans, Iranians and, now, Australians.President Trump speaks for a distinct minority of Americans. The majority of Americans love people from many countries and have welcomed them to our nation, which has been immeasurably enriched by their addition.Mr. Trump is simply an aberration. His time will pass. One hopes that sooner than later the United States will revert to being the open, friendly country that it is and aspires to be again.MARC CHAFETZWashington \n",

      "To the Editor:Re “Felony Charges for Journalists Arrested at Protests Raise Fears for Press Freedom” (news article, Jan. 26):Your headline caught my eye this morning. I expected to read that the story was about the Philippines, Pakistan, Yemen or some other war-torn, corrupt or backward country. Instead, I was appalled to learn that this happened in Washington.I’m a retired law enforcement officer and know full well that it is our mission to bring order out of chaos. I also know from years of experience that we must sort out the troublemakers from those merely in the vicinity. Sometimes, depending on circumstances, it might take a bit of time, but ultimately the job gets done.To file charges against journalists who are covering a story smacks of the vindictive tenor of the times.MacKENZIE ALLENSanta Fe, N.M. \n",

      "To the Editor:Re “Trump’s Unfashionable Tax Idea,” by Thomas Nakios (Op-Ed, Jan. 30):I am no fan of President Trump’s border adjustment tax, but I have issues with one of the reasons that Mr. Nakios and others have for opposing it: that it would raise the cost of consumer goods to unacceptable levels. I think that an increase in the price of clothing and many other consumer goods would be acceptable if the result were that the people making them were paid a decent wage.One of my favorite articles of clothing is a top made by Lilla P, one of Mr. Nakios’s labels. I have worn it well over 100 times since I bought it for about $58 nine years ago. I would have gladly paid more, and would gladly pay more again, for a really nice piece of clothing like that.Most of us have too much stuff. The world would be better off if we bought fewer things, ones that are made with respect for the people who made them and our shared environment.DIANE S. GREENBERGPalo Alto, Calif. \n",

      "To the Editor:By purging nearly all references to climate change from the White House website (news article, Jan. 21), the Trump administration has ceded yet another American leadership role to other countries, in this case, probably China.President Xi Jinping of China stated clearly in Davos the importance of supporting the Paris climate agreement (DealBook, Jan. 22). Our new government’s Luddite disregard for scientific data threatens the lives and economic well-being of all our citizens.Donald Trump may be our president, but because of backward-leaning policies, it is more and more apparent that the president of the United States is no longer leader of the free world.

      "To the Editor:“With Many Schools Thriving Nearby, Those in Harlem Are Left to Fail” (“A District Divided” series, news article, Jan. 25) repeats the myth that charter schools in Harlem have harmed the district schools there. This is not the case.From 2006 to 2016, the proportion of District 3’s Harlem students attending charters increased from 11 percent to 55 percent. During that same period, District 3’s seven district schools in Harlem with elementary grades (if combined and treated as one school) went from outperforming 27 percent of city schools to 31 percent, a four-point increase.But the charter schools in this same area collectively outperformed 89 percent of city schools on the math exam. Thus, families in Harlem are flocking to charter schools not because we’ve made district schools worse, but because of the high-quality education we offer.EVA MOSKOWITZFounder and Chief ExecutiveSuccess Academy Charter SchoolsNew York \n",

      "To the Editor:Re “Trashing America’s Ideals and Security” (editorial, Jan. 30): Where was Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and influential adviser, when Mr. Trump issued his executive order that, as you say, excludes “Muslims while giving government officials the discretion to admit people of other faiths”?Mr. Kushner is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. His grandmother’s family in Poland fled the Nazis and she did not go to the United States till several years later because at the time admission was denied to most Jews.You correctly point out that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s “silence now is alarming.” Mr. Kushner’s silence, and possible acquiescence, in this new policy, given his influence — he is supposed to be the “moderating” voice in the White House — is also troubling.SEYMOUR D.

But it was the real Mary Tyler Moore who symbolized courage.She battled alcoholism and a lifelong struggle with diabetes, and yet refused to let any of this stop her from succeeding.

If Mr. Obama chooses to do so, he should use Rule XIX, Clause 8, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, a little-known provision that gives former presidents the legal right to address the Senate upon prior notice.According to the Senate Historical Office, this rule has never been exercised before.

      "To the Editor:Re “Make  Robots Great Again,” by Farhad Manjoo (State of the Art column, Jan. 26):American investment in robots is not a solution to robots displacing human labor. In fact, it is only worsening what is now a very cruel process. The clear (and, as technology advances, accelerating) net effect of robots in the workplace is fewer and fewer human jobs.The robot manufacturing job gains touted by Mr. Manjoo do not come even remotely close to compensating for the general job losses, not to mention that robot manufacture, too, will be taken over by robots.The problem is that the profits from robotic productivity increases do not reach ordinary people. They go overwhelmingly to the rich.Through changes in tax law, wealth ownership law and so on, these profits must be redirected to where they are needed and deserved — to all families, so that our economy’s productivity gains make people’s lives better, not worse.ART SALUKPembroke Pines, Fla. \n",

To add further insult, Mr. Trump apparently hung up abruptly.Apart from Britain, the United States has no stronger ally than Australia. While Mr. Trump’s knowledge of world affairs is reportedly scant, he should realize that our two countries have stood side by side in major conflicts for over 100 years.

This is part of the Art of the Scam: Denigrate and disparage the country now so that he, and he alone, can take credit for transforming it.Within two years he will be emphasizing how much things have improved; in four years we can safely predict that he will be speaking of the greatness that he has wrought. This will all be independent of any objective evidence of tangible improvements for Americans.Donald Trump has taken over a country that is already great. As this inevitable morphing of rhetoric takes place, we need to hold him and the Republicans accountable, not be deluded by words.DAVID ROWLEYChicago \n",
