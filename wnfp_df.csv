1,Donald Trump says he’s given $5.6M to veterans groups,World News From Politics,31 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/31/donald-trump-says-hes-given-5-6m-to-veterans-groups/,"[<p>Donald Trump on Tuesday said he finally gave “close to 6 million dollars” to veterans groups, four months after making the pledge in late January.</p>, <p>The presumptive GOP presidential nominee also said the press “should be ashamed of themselves” for asking questions about the money he donated.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""281"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WX7Lto-gbPM?feature=oembed"" width=""500""></iframe></p>, <p> </p>, <p>“I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job,” Trump said, before releasing a list of the groups that received the money.</p>, <p>“As of this moment, it’s $5.6 million,” Trump added in a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Tuesday.</p>, <p>“All of the money has been spent.”</p>, <p>Trump said he didn’t release the names of the veterans organizations sooner because he wanted to respect their privacy. He insisted that the money for a number of these groups was delivered some time ago.</p>, <p>The businessman said veterans groups had been thanking him and that one gentleman was so overcome with joy that he was crying.</p>, <p>Trump spent several minutes reading out the list of veterans organizations that he said received the money from him and his friends. He said that, among others, “22 Kill” received $220,000; “Green Beret Foundation” got $350,000; and American Hero Adventures took $100,000.</p>, <p>Trump named several prominent businessmen who he said joined him in donating to the veterans groups, specifically singling out billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn for giving $500,000 and that Treasure Island casino owner Phil Ruffin for donating $1 million.</p>, <p>Trump berated the media throughout the press conference, saying the political press are “among the most dishonest people I’ve ever met.”<br/>
Instead of appearing in a Fox News debate with his presidential competitors on Jan. 28 in Iowa, Trump hosted a rally to raise money for veterans organizations.</p>, <p>During his speech that evening, Trump declared, “We just cracked 6 million, right. Six million.”</p>, <p>But in the weeks following Trump’s pledge, The Washington Post and other news outlets pressed the billionaire’s campaign for details on where the money had gone.</p>, <p>After nearly four months of media pressure, the Post reported last week that Trump had finally made good on his personal $1 million pledge.</p>, <p>Last Monday, Trump reportedly called James Kallstrom, who chairs the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation. According to its website, the charity “provides scholarships to the children of fallen United States Marines and Federal Law Enforcement Officers.”</p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281718-trump-details-funds-given-to-veterans-groups"">Source</a><br/>

2,Do anti-Trump Republicans really want to risk a Clinton presidency?,World News From Politics,31 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/31/do-anti-trump-republicans-really-want-to-risk-a-clinton-presidency/,"[<p>There have been a plethora of articles written on this election cycle and the presumptive Republican nominee, <span class=""rollover-people"">Donald Trump</span>. Trump’s political rise has been analyzed over and over by journalists and scholars alike, all trying to explain this polarizing figure, his unorthodox campaign and the phenomenon that has set ripples throughout the political process. None of us — and likely none of you — saw any of this coming six months ago.</p>, <p>Many would have been willing to bet that Trump’s 15 minutes of fame were just that, a temporary breaking wave in the large sea that is politics. Yet, somehow he has emerged as a political juggernaut. Much like a fictional supervillain published by Marvel Comics, Trump crushes all in his path. Becoming nearly impenetrable as his candidacy gained steam, he seemingly withstands blow after blow, always rising to the top — even when challenged on the veracity of his statements or asked questions about his past.</p>, <p>Several months ago, many in the Republican Party — including me — would have been willing to bet that Trump’s accession to the front-runner post and now ultimately the GOP nomination would have never been possible. However, what was once thought of as an impossible feat is now reality, and it is the current reality that the Republican Party must face.</p>, <p>There are two fundamental questions that remain unanswered: the possible expansion of government and whether or not Trump’s detractors are seriously willing to lose this election to likely Democratic nominee <span class=""rollover-people"">Hillary Clinton</span>. The latter is concerning because this isn’t a presidential election where we as a party can regroup over the next four years, but an election that could potentially change the face of the nation. These concerns must keep any conservative awake at night and are fundamental to the direction of America.</p>, <p>Clinton represents the past, all that was and all that never will be. If elected, her election would be the furtherance of failed foreign policy and government expansion, not to mention the decades of change that would come from her potential appointees to the Supreme Court. It should be obvious, from the perspective of a conservative, that she is a dangerous choice. Yet some in the Republican Party are willing to further divide the party in hopes of a third-party savior who would be unlikely to win the general election. Such a possibility would only guarantee a victory for Clinton, which Republicans must not easily allow. Republicans have an obligation to put forth a competitive campaign to beat her. If she wins, the party has the benefit of saying it tried. After all, she represents the antithesis of any logical and rational proponent of conservatism. They cannot justify allowing Clinton to waltz into the White House without a real challenge.</p>, <p>Republicans who oppose Trump should meet him and address their concerns. Such a meeting would allow those who oppose him to bring their concerns to the forefront with the hopes of finding common ground and helping Trump become a better candidate. Those who refuse to even meet and discuss their concerns are, in many ways, assisting Clinton. Maintaining such a disposition isn’t practical or logical. Any person concerned with making an intellectual case for conservatism, small and large, should immediately recognize this.</p>, <p>This election is about more than Trump. It is about fundamental change to the American society — liberalism versus conservatism — and those opposing Trump must get over their egos or risk a Clinton administration, which means bigger government, higher taxes and a weak foreign policy. Those issues are far too grave to ignore.</p>, <p>I understand Donald Trump’s detractors. However, when assessing the overall picture, their actions will only cause greater harm for the party and the country as a whole, and will automatically guarantee a victory for Clinton and the furtherance of liberalism — which may work in part, but most certainly not in whole. A fractured GOP only causes further harm to the American people and those unwilling to come together will be responsible for the fundamental change that will come via Clinton’s liberal policies. And that, ultimately, is indefensible.</p>, <p><em>Singleton is a Republican political consultant who has worked on Newt Gingrich’s and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns, and most recently, Dr. Ben Carson’s.

3,Bernie Sanders supporters have a point,World News From Politics,31 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/31/bernie-sanders-supporters-have-a-point/,"[<p>Why is it such a mystery to mainstream Democrats that supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (Vt.) bid for the nomination might not be willing to roll over? Do these Democrats have doubts about their candidate? Is it possible that in this post-racial world, where we are all warm and fuzzy about moving from the first African-American president to our first female president, it doesn’t feel like her appeal alone is enough to fend off a scary demagogue? The reason for Sanders staying until the very last vote is so he can insure that the presumptive candidate “pays” for his support and his endorsement. His doing so and likely nominee Hillary Clinton’s concessions, when they come, will be an essential element in her election.</p>, <p>Anyone who knows the lore of presidential politics knows candidates play to the extremists in their party during the primaries and move to the middle in the general election. So the professional political class has seen presumptive Democratic nominee Donald Trump start his vacillation on a variety of issues since his win in the Indiana primary and the polls show that 84 percent of Republican Party loyalists intend to vote for him. As Trump starts his mudslinging at Clinton and begins wooing anyone he can think of from the Democratic side of the ledger, mainstream Democrats are faced with polling that shows Trump narrowing the gap with Clinton. No wonder the sweat beads are starting to form on their collective brow.<br/>
So why not criticize Sanders? He surely deserves it. Given the current and prospective delegate count, he has no chance of winning the nomination. And, according to pundit thinking, the fact that “rigged” primary selection procedures place the candidate selection in the hands of the party elites might seem unfair but they “were the rules he accepted when he entered the race,” so the argument goes. Plus, he trails Clinton by almost 3 million votes when all primaries are tallied. So what is Sanders’s problem? Clinton has already acknowledged the progressive agenda. She has 112 reasons listed on her website as to why she is a “progressive who gets things done.” Most of her positions mimic, if not mirror, the progressive agenda.</p>, <p>Indeed, whatever might be the problem? The problem is that she is a DINO (Democrat in Name Only). The problem is that she, along with her husband, trashed the core values of the Democratic Party in the 1990s and threw the American workers under the proverbial bus. They essentially became more Republican than Republicans. Perhaps it was a slip of the tongue while campaigning in Kentucky, but she offered up her husband as the person who would carry the flag on the economy once she is in office. Really?</p>, <p>An example is in order. We know she decided that she was against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after she was for it. Is her plan to turn the issue over to the godfather of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)? Is there any question in anyone’s mind that a candidate who has wrapped herself in the cloak of the incumbent president (whose team negotiated the TPP), will not, upon victory, become “pragmatic”? It’s unlikely she will continue to oppose what Sanders has described as “part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.”</p>, <p>You would have to be as dumb as a post to think that Clinton might not lean in to the middle and change positions and support the TPP. And that is only one issue. There are literally a score of issues where you can give odds that workers will lose to the pragmatism of a “progressive who gets things done.”</p>, <p>So the distrust is manifest and the party convention looms. It can go two ways. The convention can be disruptive and rowdy beyond belief, especially if Sanders is close or wins California and superdelegates maintain their commitment to support Clinton. Or, the pressure and support of Sander’s remarkable candidacy is given some sway in the form of “assurances,” commitments or concessions. The talking heads would have us believe that Sanders will get his hour for a speech and the party will grant him verbiage on the party platform which, by the way, they assure us is non-binding on the candidate.</p>, <p>That dog won’t hunt. So what concessions would be required for his support and willingness to stump for Clinton and the down-ballot contestants? He must demand a progressive vice presidential choice like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and a signed pledge to support the major components of his agenda: a minimum wage increase, tax reform, student loan relief, educational supports, campaign finance reform, antitrust legislation, trade policy and support for renewable energy, reduced military spending and a restraint on foreign wars. Why wouldn’t she sign? It would be a pledge like the Grover Norquist and the Americans For Tax Reform pledge for Republicans to shoot themselves before ever voting for increased taxes. The Sanders pledge can be routed to down-ballot candidates. The Democratic Party would then be pledged to support its core constituents. It could be used as a challenge to Trump and the misplaced support white middle-class wage earners have given for hollow promises of a new and great America.</p>, <p>Being forced to sign will drive Hillary Clinton crazy, but with all the disruption that Bernie Sanders can cause by not supporting her, she will have no choice. Sanders can then return to the Senate, organize the Progressive Caucus and start pounding out the needed legislative reforms.</p>, <p>Russell is managing director of Cove Hill Advisory Services.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/281685-sanders-supporters-have-a-point"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.popsugar.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""205""/>

4,Donald Trump at war with press over donations to veterans groups,World News From Politics,31 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/31/donald-trump-at-war-with-press-over-donations-to-veterans-groups/,"[<p>Donald Trump lashed out at the press over scrutiny of the money he raised to donate to veterans groups, in one instance pointing to a reporter and calling him a “sleaze.”</p>, <p>At a press conference in Trump Tower on Tuesday, Trump announced that he’d give $6 million — including $1 million of his money — to a variety of veterans groups.<br/>
But Trump became irritated by reporters who questioned why it had taken so long to make the donation, noting that Trump held the fundraiser for veterans all the way back in January.<br/>
“It seems to me you’re resistant to the kind of scrutiny that you get with running for president of the United States?” said CNN anchor Jim Acosta.</p>, <p>Trump responded: “I like scrutiny, but you know what, when I raise money — excuse me, excuse me, I’ve watched you on television and you’re a real beauty — when I raise money for the veterans, and it’s a massive amount of money — find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans, it’s nothing.”</p>, <p>“I don’t want the credit for it, but I don’t want to be lambasted,” Trump added.</p>, <p>Later, Trump pointed to an ABC reporter and called him a “sleaze.”</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""281"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGsCkGnQlZo?feature=oembed"" width=""500""></iframe></p>, <p> </p>, <p>“What I don’t want is when I raise millions of dollars, and this sleazy guy over here — look, he’s a sleaze in my book,” Trump said. “You’re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.”</p>, <p>Trump then turned his back and turned the press conference over to one of the veterans who had flanked him on stage.</p>, <p>That moment capped a tense few minutes of back and forth between Trump and the press.</p>, <p>“Writing a million dollar check is incredibly generous … but your critics say you exaggerate. Is this a prime example?” one reporter said. “Why exaggerate?”</p>, <p>“When Democrats are raising questions, the press is also reflecting what your opposition is saying about you,” said another reporter. “We’re not just us throwing questions at you.”</p>, <p>Trump responded that he didn’t mind the criticism coming from the opposition, but said it’s different when it comes from the press.</p>, <p>“I think the political press is among the most dishonest I’ve ever seen,’ he said. “I have to tell you that. But I think the political press — I see the stories and the way they’re couched.”</p>, <p>As the press conference ended, a reporter told Trump he had “set a new bar in being contentious with the press” and asked whether this is what it would be like if Trump wins the White House.</p>, <p>“Yeah it is,” Trump responded.</p>, <p>“I’m going to continue to attack the press,” he added. “I find the press to be dishonest. I find the political press to be extremely dishonest.”</p>, <p>So far, Trump said $5.6 million had gone from his organization to veterans groups.</p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281721-trump-berates-press-for-scrutiny-of-donations-to-vets"">Source</a><br/>

At the beginning of his show, Kimmel offered to moderate.</p>, <p>Just the possibility of a Trump-Sanders debate set the media sphere ablaze.</p>, <p>Political watchers are clearly excited by the potential showdown between a world-famous billionaire reality TV star and a self-identified democratic socialist whose long-shot presidential bid has transformed him from a back-bench senator to a pop culture phenomenon.</p>, <p>The proposal actually began as a joke between Trump and Kimmel, but it quickly gained steam from there.</p>, <p>Ahead of Trump’s appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Wednesday night, the Sanders camp was given the chance to submit a question for the host to ask Trump and chose to challenge him to the debate.</p>, <p>Trump told Kimmel in response that he’d be open to debating Sanders.</p>, <p>A Trump campaign official described the remarks to The Hill on Thursday morning as “tongue-in-cheek.”</p>, <p>But Trump appears to have underestimated Sanders’s seriousness about the notion, and Sanders quickly responded on Twitter during the broadcast, saying “Game on.”</p>, <p>Sanders has little to lose in his primary contest and badly needs a game-changing event. He has been unable to persuade Clinton to agree to another debate before the California primary on June 7.</p>, <p>Sanders pounced on the opening Trump gave him, and the Republican’s remarks soon took on a life of their own.</p>, <p>Trump had fun with it at press conference in North Dakota, exhibiting his trademark swagger.</p>, <p>“The problem with debating Bernie is that he’d lose,” Trump remarked.</p>, <p>But Trump passed on an opportunity to keep the conversation going during Sanders’s appearance on Kimmel’s show; he instead submitted a question about Sanders running as an independent if party leaders “steal” the nomination from him.</p>, <p>A debate between the two would come at a strange time in the presidential cycle.</p>, <p>Clinton could potentially secure the Democratic nomination on June 7, but a Trump-Sanders debate could potentially drain that accomplishment of a lot of excitement.</p>, <p>She brushed off the potential debate as a joke when asked about it Thursday.</p>, <p>Sanders has long argued that he’s the better candidate to face Trump. And the debate would give him the opportunity to prove that while drawing attention to the fact that Clinton declined to participate in another Democratic debate.</p>, <p>“This is just an unbelievable spectacle,” Bannon said. “It really upstages Hillary at a critical time for her. The Clinton folks must be furious.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281463-trump-sanders-whip-up-debate-buzz"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.travelandleisure.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/JimmyKimmelLive/videos"">Video Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""198""/>

We’re going to bring in someone else,” Sanders said.</p>, <p>“I happen to like Joe a lot, but I think that would be a very, very serious blunder for the Democratic Party,” he added.</p>, <p>Biden has said often he isn’t interested in running for president, citing the death of his son Beau last year as the main reason.</p>, <p>Clinton leads Sanders big in the Democratic presidential race, but Sanders has vowed to stay in the race until the Democratic convention this summer.</p>, <p>Clinton faces a potential indictment as the FBI investigates the private email server she used while serving as secretary of State.

7,Feds fight to prevent Clinton deposition in email case,World News From Politics,28 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/28/feds-fight-to-prevent-clinton-deposition-in-email-case/,"[<p>The Obama administration is trying to prevent former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from being deposed in an ongoing open records case connected to her use of a private email server.</p>, <p>Late Thursday evening, the Justice Department filed a court motion opposing the Clinton deposition request from conservative legal watchdog Judicial Watch, claiming that the organization was trying to dramatically expand the scope of the lawsuit.<br/>
Judicial Watch is “seeking instead to transform these proceedings into a wide-ranging inquiry into matters beyond the scope of the court’s order and unrelated to the FOIA request at issue in this case,” government lawyers wrote in their filing, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.<br/>
The lawyers wrote that the request to interview Clinton “is wholly inappropriate” before depositions are finished in a separate case also concerning the email server.</p>, <p>Judicial Watch’s FOIA case began as a way to seek documents about talking points related to the 2012 terror attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, but has since grown to encompass wider questions about Clinton’s use of a personal server while working as secretary of State.</p>, <p>Last week, Judicial Watch asked the court to interview Clinton and five other current and former State Department officials about the server, after it received a judge’s permission to move ahead with the process.</p>, <p>The case is the second in which Judicial Watch has been granted approval to depose witnesses to gather evidence about Clinton’s email setup. In the other case, interviews of current and former Clinton aides have already begun.</p>, <p>Clinton is not scheduled to answer questions as part of that case, through a federal judge has warned that she could be called upon in the future.</p>, <p>In the government’s filing late Thursday, the Justice Department said that Judicial Watch’s request is “overbroad and duplicative.”</p>, <p>Instead, it claimed, the group should complete the depositions in the other case first before demanding an interview of Clinton and the other officials.</p>, <p>However, the department did say that it would not oppose a request to subpoena Jake Sullivan, a former senior State Department official and current top aide in Clinton’s presidential campaign, as long as questions were “on the limited topic” of officials using personal email accounts at the department.</p>, <p>The department also said it would be willing to provide an unnamed witness to provide answers on behalf of the State Department in response to narrow questions about the FOIA request at the heart of the case.</p>, <p>That solution, government lawyers claimed, would “avoid the burden and expense” of going through a deposition process “that replicates activities already underway in another, overlapping case between the parties.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/281565-feds-fight-to-prevent-clinton-deposition-in-email-case"">Source</a><br/>

8,Sanders mocks ‘tough guy’ Trump for changing mind on debate,World News From Politics,28 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/28/sanders-mocks-tough-guy-trump-for-changing-mind-on-debate/,"[<p>Bernie Sanders took to late-night TV on Friday to poke fun at Donald Trump for refusing to debate him.</p>, <p>Sanders lamented to HBO “Real Time” host Bill Maher that he “would have loved” to debate Trump.<br/>
The idea of an unprecedented debate between Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and Sanders, a Democratic candidate, captivated the political world in recent days, but Trump threw cold water on the idea Friday afternoon.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""281"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0kCHZdKdBY?feature=oembed"" width=""500""></iframe></p>, <p>“First he said he would do it.

You know, Trump claims to be a real tough guy, pushes people around. Hey, Donald, come on up. Let’s have a debate about the future of America.”</p>, <p>“Mr. Macho chickened out,” added Maher, an avowed Sanders supporter.</p>, <p>Sanders said Trump as president “would be not only an embarrassment, a real danger to this entire world.”</p>, <p>The Vermont senator added that Trump would be hard to run against in the general election because “he lies all the time, because he changes his mind all the time.”</p>, <p>Trump on Friday said it would be “inappropriate” to debate Sanders, calling him a “second place finisher.”</p>, <p>His statement ended days of speculation that began when Trump said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Wednesday night that he would be willing to face Sanders in an unusual, bipartisan debate if it raised money for charity.</p>, <p>Trump said Thursday he would “love to debate Bernie,” one day before backing out.</p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281589-sanders-mocks-tough-guy-trump-for-changing-mind-on-debate"">Source</a><br/>

9,Hillary Clinton email headache is about to get worse,World News From Politics,28 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/28/hillary-clinton-email-headache-is-about-to-get-worse/,"[<p>Hillary Clinton’s email headache is about to get even worse.</p>, <p>A scathing inspector general’s report this week was just the first in what is likely to be a series of official actions related to her private server stemming from the FBI, a federal courthouse and Capitol Hill.<br/>
Clinton’s presidential campaign has failed to quiet the furor over the issue, which has dogged her for more than a year.<br/>
In the next few weeks — just as the likely Democratic presidential nominee hopes to pivot towards a general election — it will face its toughest scrutiny yet.</p>, <p>“All of that feeds into this overarching problem of public distrust of her,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University.</p>, <p>“To put it in slang terms, she’s got a pretty deeply held street rep at this point. This fits the street rep,” he added.</p>, <p>The State Department’s watchdog report was especially damaging, given the official nature of its source. The report claimed that Clinton never sought approval for her “homebrew” email setup, that her use of the system violated the department’s record-keeping rules and that it would have been rejected had she brought it up to department officials.</p>, <p>Clinton’s allies attempted to paint the office as partisan in the weeks ahead of the report’s release, but the effort failed to leave a lasting impact.</p>, <p>For months, Clinton and her team have failed to offer a convincing explanation for the use of the private server, and she has steadfastly refused to apologize.</p>, <p>“I thought it was allowed,” she said in an interview on CNN’s “The Situation Room” this week, after the watchdog’s report became public. “I knew past secretaries of state used personal email.</p>, <p>“It was still a mistake. If I could go back, I’d do it differently,” she said.</p>, <p>Clinton and many of her top aides declined to take part in the inspector general’s probe. But they won’t have that option going forward.</p>, <p>On Friday, Clinton’s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills was interviewed behind closed doors as part of a court case launched by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch. In coming weeks, longtime aide Huma Abedin, former IT specialist Bryan Pagliano and other officials are scheduled to answer questions under oath for sessions that could last as long as seven hours.</p>, <p>A federal judge this week preemptively blocked Judicial Watch from releasing videotapes of the upcoming depositions.</p>, <p>But the group this week released the transcript from its first interview, with longtime State Department veteran Lewis Lukens. And it plans to do the same thing following each of the upcoming depositions, providing fodder for weeks to come from some of the closest rings of Clinton’s inner circle.</p>, <p>The court has said that Clinton herself may be forced to answer questions under oath, which would dramatically escalate the brouhaha surrounding the case.</p>, <p>At some point in the next month, the House Select Committee on Benghazi is also set to release its long-awaited report about the 2012 terror attack, which has been linked to Clinton.</p>, <p>The committee has pursued Clinton’s emails to the extent that they relate to the violence in Libya, and the report is likely to stoke new ire about the matter. However, its two-year investigation has been marred by partisan bickering, and the report will likely be shrugged off by Democrats.</p>, <p>What is potentially profoundly more damaging for Clinton is the looming FBI investigation, exploring the possibility that she or her aides mishandled classified information.</p>, <p>More than 2,000 emails that Clinton gave the State Department from her private server have been classified at some level, and 22 were marked as “top secret” — the highest level of classification — and deemed too dangerous to release publicly even in a highly redacted form. However, none of the emails were marked as classified at the time they were sent, complicating the investigation into whether her setup thwarted any laws.</p>, <p>Abedin, Mills and other Clinton aides have reportedly been interviewed as part of the FBI case. And Clinton herself is due up for questioning at some point.</p>, <p>Legal experts appear skeptical that the Justice Department would hand down a criminal charge against Clinton, due to both the high legal hurdles involved and the intense political scrutiny surrounding the likely presidential nominee.</p>, <p>But that won’t end the matter.</p>, <p>Republicans appear primed to cry foul if the FBI closes its investigation without handing down indictments or offering a public explanation. Senior lawmakers have already excoriated the Justice Department for failing to appoint a special prosecutor.</p>, <p>“It’s clear that the attorney general, who serves at the pleasure of President Obama, is going to have very little incentive or intention to pursue the appropriate investigation,” Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on the chamber floor this week.</p>, <p>Other Senate Republicans, including Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) have launched their own investigations related to Clinton’s email. Some of their findings, Grassley said this week, were at odds with those of the State Department’s inspector general report.</p>, <p>“I will follow up to get to the bottom of these discrepancies because misrepresenting the facts to Congress is unacceptable,” Grassley pledged.</p>, <p>How much the email issue hurts Clinton’s electoral hopes remains an open question. Results of the June 7 primary contest in California, the nation’s largest state, could offer some clues about whether the email scrutiny hurts her polling.</p>, <p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her primary opponent, has stubbornly refused to address the issue, memorably declaring in October that people “are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”</p>, <p>Recent events have disproved that claim.</p>, <p>And as she gears up for a general election, Clinton has to expect that Donald Trump won’t be as kind.</p>, <p>Sanders “didn’t pick up on the emails, which I think was a big mistake,” the presumptive GOP nominee said on “Fox and Friends” last weekend.</p>, <p>“I’m going to pick up bigly.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/281554-clinton-email-headache-is-about-to-get-worse"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""186""/>

10,Trump: “I’d love to debate Bernie” to raise $10M for charity,World News From Politics,27 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/27/trump-id-love-to-debate-bernie-to-raise-10m-for-charity/,"[<p>Donald Trump on Thursday said he would “love” to debate Bernie Sanders — as long as the event raised money for charity.<br/>
“I’d love to debate Bernie. He’s a dream,” he told reporters in Bismarck, N.D.<br/>
“So what we can do, if we can raise for maybe women’s health issues or something — if we can raise 10 or 15 million dollars for charity, which would be a very appropriate amount. I understand the television business very well.”</p>, <p>A debate between Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, while the primaries are still ongoing would be unprecedented.</p>, <p>The Sanders campaign told The Hill earlier Thursday that the Vermont senator is eager to make the debate happen, although the two sides had not discussed it.</p>, <p>“The senator wants to do it,” Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said. “We’ll see if Trump meant what he said.”</p>, <p>According to Briggs, the Sanders campaign was given the opportunity to submit a question to ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” for Kimmel to ask Trump. Sanders chose to ask whether the presumptive GOP nominee is willing to debate him.</p>, <p>“Yes, I am,” Trump said. “How much is he going to pay me? If he paid a nice sum toward a charity, I’d love to do that.”</p>, <p>Sanders accepted his offer shortly after on Twitter, and proposed holding the debate in California ahead of the state’s June 7 primary.</p>, <p>And on Thursday, the Sanders camp reiterated its desire to debate Trump.</p>, <p>“We are ready to debate Donald Trump,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “We hope he will not chicken out. I think it will be great for America to see these two candidates and the different visions they have for America going forward. What we’ll have to see, Wolf, is does Donald Trump have the courage to get on the stage with Bernie Sanders.

11,Hillary Clinton laughs off idea of Trump-Sanders debate,World News From Politics,27 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/27/hillary-clinton-laughs-off-idea-of-trump-sanders-debate/,"[<p><span class=""rollover-people"">Hillary Clinton</span> is dismissing talks of a presidential debate between <span class=""rollover-people"">Bernie Sanders</span> and <span class=""rollover-people"">Donald Trump</span>.</p>, <p>“I don’t think it’s going to happen,” the Democratic front-runner said Thursday during a call-in to “Meet the Press Daily” on MSNBC. “You know, I know they’ve gone back and forth on this, and they seem to be saying it’s some kind of joke. Trump doesn’t sound very serious.”</p>, <p>“But I can tell you, I look forward to debating Donald Trump in the general election. I can’t wait to get on that debate stage with him.”</p>, <p>The Sanders and Trump campaigns are reportedly engaged in “back-channel conversations” to arrange a debate for the two presidential candidates after Trump said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Wednesday he’d be open to it.</p>, <p>Trump then told reporters Thursday Sanders is “a dream” and he would love to debate him.</p>, <p>“So what we can do, if we can raise for maybe women’s health issues or something — if we can raise 10 or 15 million dollars for charity, which would be a very appropriate amount. I understand the television business very well.”</p>, <p>Sanders’s campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Thursday a debate would “benefit voters from across the country.”</p>, <p>“I have to believe it would be one of the most-watched debates in presidential politics,”Weaver told MSNBC.</p>, <p>Clinton dismissed the proposed debate again minutes later during a phone interview with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer.</p>, <p>“Oh Wolf, this doesn’t sound like a serious discussion,” she said. “I’m looking forward to debating Donald Trump in the general election.

“I raised almost $6 million for the veterans, including putting up $1 million of my own money. I had no obligation to do anything or to do so, and I get nothing but bad press from the dishonest media. It is absolutely disgraceful,” the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said in an Instagram video. “Why don’t they look into the Clinton Foundation, you want to see dishonesty.”<br/>
Hillary Clinton, Trump’s likely Democratic opponent in the presidential election, has been a member of the foundation started by her husband.</p>, <p>Trump previously defended his donations to veterans in a series of tweets after The Washington Post reported that the campaign admitted to raising less than Trump had claimed.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>“While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS.

Trump” is listed on the nonprofit’s website as giving between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>, <p>Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is also listed on the website as a donor who has given between $5,001 and $10,000.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/281053-trump-suggests-dishonest-media-investigate-the-clinton-foundation"">Source</a><br/>

People dissent,” he said during an interview with NBC’s “Today” show. “If we take your assumption and Clinton’s supporters’ assumption of the logical conclusion, you know what we should do? We should go back to a monarchy and not have any elections at all.”</p>, <p>Sanders rejected the idea that his candidacy hurts Clinton’s poll numbers delaying party unity. He also tried to temper his recent comment that the Democratic National Convention could get “messy,” which raised eyebrows after a contentious party convention in Nevada erupted into heated protests earlier this month.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>“The media takes words out of context. The context of that was ‘democracy is messy,’ that people will have a vigorous debate on the issues,” he said.</p>, <p>But when asked specifically whether he believed the party’s national convention in July would get messy, Sanders said, “Of course it will be — that’s what democracy is about.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>He brushed aside questions about whether he would campaign for Clinton in the fall, cutting off NBC’s Kristen Welker when she tried to ask.

16,Clinton allies blame Bernie for bad polls,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/clinton-allies-blame-bernie-for-bad-polls/,"[<p><span class=""rollover-people"">Hillary Clinton</span> allies worried about polls that suggest a tightening general election match-up with <span class=""rollover-people"">Donald Trump</span> are placing blame on <span class=""rollover-people"">Bernie Sanders</span>.</p>, <p>They say that the long primary fight with the independent senator from Vermont, which looks like it could go all the way to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, has taken a toll on Clinton’s standing in the polls. In the latest RealClearPolitics average,she is two-tenths of a point behind Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.</p>, <p>The surrogates say they’re concerned that Sanders is still — this late in the game — throwing shots at Clinton and the Democratic establishment.</p>, <p>“I don’t think he realizes the damage he’s doing at this point,” one ally said of Sanders. “I understand running the campaign until the end, fine. But at least take the steps to begin bringing everyone together.”</p>, <p>In an interview with ABC on Sunday, Sanders called voting for Clinton in the general election “the lesser of two evils.”</p>, <p>He has also kept up a steady drumbeat of criticism against the Democratic National Committee and its chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who his supporters charge is rigging the contest against Sanders.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>A series of polls over the weekend all point to a tightening general election race between Trump and Clinton, who needs 90 more delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press. The news group includes superdelegates who have committed to each candidate in its totals. Clinton has a huge lead over Sanders in superdelegates, the party officials who will cast votes at the convention for a nominee.</p>, <p>An ABC News/Washington Post poll showed the billionaire businessman with a 2-point national lead, 46 percent to 44 percent. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll had Clinton up 46 percent to 43 percent. Last month, Clinton held an 11-point lead in that poll.</p>, <p>Swing states also suggest a tight race.</p>, <p>In Florida, a CBS/YouGov poll has Clinton up by just 1 point over Trump, 43 percent to 42 percent. In Ohio, the same poll showed the former secretary of State with a 4-point lead.</p>, <p>“I’ve said all along that opposing Trump isn’t going to be easy,” the Clinton ally said. “In fact, he’s probably one of the toughest opponents we could have. There’s a reason he knocked out every other opponent in the Republican primary.”</p>, <p>To be sure, Clinton has problems and vulnerabilities that go beyond Sanders. Her favorability numbers are weak for a major-party nominee at this stage of the campaign.</p>, <p>She is also still waiting for the FBI to finish its investigation of her use of a private email server while at State.</p>, <p>Still, it is the Sanders problem that is now on the front burner of concerns for Clinton and her supporters.</p>, <p>Just two months before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Clinton has yet to lock up a nomination that would allow her to focus her fire on Trump amid an effort to unify Democrats around her candidacy.</p>, <p>Instead, Sanders supporters online are loudly declaring no end to the “Bernie or bust” motto even as Republicans increasingly rally around Trump as their own nominee.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>“It holds her back from controlling the narrative,” another Clinton ally said of Sanders’s continued presence in the race.</p>, <p>The polls indicating a tight general election race have cemented a belief in Clinton World that the candidate needs to devote all her time now to the general election.</p>, <p>Publicly, Clinton has downplayed the polls, dismissing them when asked Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>, <p>“Polls this far out mean nothing,” she told the show’s moderator, Chuck Todd. “They certainly mean nothing to me. And I think if people go back and look, they really mean nothing in terms of analyzing what’s going to happen in the fall.”</p>, <p>At the same time, she added that the campaign is “not going to let Donald Trump try to normalize himself” while she still opposes Sanders in the primary.</p>, <p>“I’m going to keep focused on Donald Trump because I will be the nominee. I will be running against Donald Trump in the fall and I do not want Americans, and, you know, good, thinking Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe this is a normal candidacy,” she said. “It isn’t.”</p>, <p>Grant Reeher, the director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, attributes tightening in the polls to Trump solidifying support from Republicans.</p>, <p>“That’s definitely helping him,” Reeher said.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>One Democratic strategist and veteran of the 2004 and 2008 election cycles predicted that Clinton would see a similar bounce in the polls if Sanders were to exit the race.</p>, <p>“I’ve never seen an advantage this big before on issues like preparedness to be president, and a big majority of Sanders supporters already say they’ll support her as the nominee,” the strategist said.</p>, <p>The political veteran also said the current situation is favorable for Clinton compared to the Democratic divide that <span class=""rollover-people"">Barack Obama</span> faced in 2008 after his hard-fought primary victory over Clinton. In that case, Clinton voters did come home to Obama.</p>, <p>“Most importantly, you’ve never had 70 percent of voters saying a nominee doesn’t have the temperament to be president,” the strategist said, referring to polls about Trump. “This is unprecedented at this stage.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280994-clinton-allies-blame-bernie-for-bad-polls"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://kalw.org/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""153""/>

17,Bernie’s not-so-secret-weapon,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/bernies-not-so-secret-weapon/,"[<p>or months, Bernie Sanders and his supporters have pointed to polls that show him running comfortably ahead of Donald Trump in November. But now that Hillary Clinton’s lead over Trump has disappeared — and the two likely nominees are now running neck-and-neck in national polls — his argument is gaining new resonance.</p>, <p>Clinton and her campaign argue that the Vermont senator hasn’t undergone the kind of scrutiny that Clinton and Trump have — and that his poll numbers are over-inflated compared to candidates who have faced intense political attacks from the other party.</p>, <p>The data remain unequivocal, however: The latest averages from HuffPost Pollster give Clinton a just <u>less-than-2-point advantage</u> over Trump, while Sanders — who is virtually certain to finish well behind Clinton in pledged delegates — leads Trump <u>by 10</u><u> points</u>. Trump has narrowed Clinton’s lead by 5 points since the end of April, while he’s only chipped 2 points off Sanders’ edge.</p>, <p>Moreover, there’s evidence that Clinton will face challenges uniting Democrats the way Trump has brought Republicans together since eliminating his opponents. Sanders’ backers appear increasingly hostile to Clinton, polls show — especially those voters who currently favor Sanders over Trump but say they would defect to the Republican if Clinton is the Democratic nominee.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The debate isn’t just academic. Part of Sanders’ last-ditch argument to the unpledged superdelegates he’d need to win over to have any hope of winning the Democratic nomination is that they should consider which candidate would run best against Trump before making their choice.</p>, <p>“Virtually every poll taken in the last two months has me doing better against Trump than Hillary Clinton,” Sanders <u>said</u> on CNN on Sunday.</p>, <p>Clinton and her campaign have dismissed that argument repeatedly over the past few months, maintaining that Sanders hasn’t been assailed as Clinton has. Clinton hasn’t gone negative on Sanders with paid media thus far — and with the former secretary of state poised to emerge as the pledged-delegate leader at the end of the voting next month, it’s unlikely Sanders will be the subject of attack ads over the next three weeks.</p>, <p>“I don’t think he’s had a single negative ad ever run against him,” Clinton said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And that’s fine. But we know what we’re going into, and we understand what it’s going to take to win in the fall.”</p>, <p>Three polls conducted last week confirm Sanders’ advantage in the general election: An <u>NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</u> released on Sunday showed Clinton leading Trump by 3 points, 46 percent to 43 percent. Sanders, on the other hand, had a commanding 15-point advantage, 54 percent to 39 percent.</p>, <p>Last week, a <u>Fox News poll</u> showed Clinton trailing Trump by 3 points, but Sanders ahead by 4 points. A <u>CBS News/New York </u><u>Times poll</u> was better for Clinton, showing her leading Trump by 6 points. But Sanders was 13 points clear of Trump, that survey showed.</p>, <p>Some pollsters, in fact, aren’t even asking about a potential Sanders-Trump matchup. An <u>ABC News/Washington Post poll</u> out this weekend didn’t include Sanders in the general-election trial heats. The poll matched Clinton against Trump — showing Trump leading Clinton among registered voters, 46 percent to 44 percent — then added a hypothetical three-way race including 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as an independent candidate.</p>, <p>The ballot test isn’t the only survey data point pointing to Sanders’ strong position — and the shortcomings of both Trump and Clinton. According to HuffPost Pollster, Sanders’ average image rating <u>stands at</u> 50 percent favorable and 41 percent unfavorable. That’s far better than the historically poor ratings for Trump (39 percent favorable/57 percent unfavorable) and Clinton (41 percent favorable/55 percent unfavorable).</p>, <p>Clinton has one distinct advantage over Sanders: More Democrats want her to be the party’s nominee — a finding reflected not just in election returns over the past five months, but also in more recent national polling. Clinton has <u>a 12-point lead</u> in the latest polls measuring the preferences of Democrats nationally.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>But, increasingly, there are warning signs that Clinton could struggle to bring those Sanders supporters into the fold. While about two-thirds of Sanders backers in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll say they would vote for Clinton over Trump, Clinton’s image rating stands at only 38 percent positive/41 percent negative.</p>, <p>And last week’s NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll — an online, large-sample survey that allows for analysis of smaller subgroups — profiles the small-but-significant pool of voters who are choosing Sanders over Trump, but defect to Trump over Clinton.</p>, <p>The data suggest it will be difficult for Clinton to win them over: Ninety-one percent of these Sanders-Trump voters have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton — including a staggering 73 percent who have a strongly unfavorable opinion.</p>, <p>Democrats are adamant that Clinton will be able to unify the party after she clinches the nomination. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who is advising the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA, <u>told POLITICO last week</u> that “it’s certain that Clinton would benefit from putting the intraparty divisiveness behind her in the same way that Trump has benefited from that on his side.”</p>, <p>But it’s not clear that Clinton has the room to grow that Trump did after he knocked out his GOP rivals: Trump is managing to win from 80 percent to 90 percent of self-identified Republicans in the polls, roughly equal to Clinton’s share of the Democratic vote. Sanders isn’t beating Trump because he’s winning more Democrats; polls show he’s winning over more independents and even a few Republicans.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Still, Trump has mostly unified the GOP against steep odds. Even as late as the Indiana primary earlier this month, 42 percent of GOP primary voters said they would be “scared” or “concerned” if Trump were elected president. And a number of prominent Republicans — including House Speaker Paul Ryan — still haven’t expressed public support for Trump’s candidacy.</p>, <p>For Democrats, pre-election surveys and exit polls alike have shown a greater inclination for unity than their Republican counterparts. But as Sanders continues to press his argument — and Trump runs neck-and-neck with Clinton — the process of<b> </b>bringing Sanders voters into the fold becomes more difficult for Clinton as she seeks to reclaim her polling lead over Trump headed into the summer.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/bernies-not-so-secret-weapon-223492"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://theslot.jezebel.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""150""/>

18,Russia and Putin sued over downing of MH17 over Ukraine,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/russia-and-putin-sued-over-downing-of-mh17-over-ukraine/,"[<p>Relatives of victims of the Malaysian airliner shot down over Ukraine in July 2014 are suing Russia and President Vladimir Putin over their alleged involvement in the incident.<br/>
LHD, an Australian law firm, said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit at the European Court of Human Rights seeking damages of $10m per passenger in relation to the downing of the jet in pro-Russian rebel-held territory, which killed all 298 passengers on board.</p>, <p>“We have submitted almost 2,000 pages of documentary evidence which indicate that Russians were present, Russian heavy military equipment was present; it was photographed, witnessed, videoed and geo-located to the area where the missile was fired from,” said Jerry Skinner, special counsel with LHD.<br/>
Mr Skinner told Australian radio the lawsuit was filed on behalf of 33 next of kin of seven families from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. He said the action was intended to be “a deterrent or punishment for undesirable conduct”, which he alleges was perpetrated by Russia and Mr Putin.</p>, <p>The shooting down of flight MH17 during a conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels prompted the UN to issue a resolution condemning the “tragic loss” of lives and calling for an independent investigation. Two-thirds of the 298 victims on the flight between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur were Dutch, with the remainder coming from Australia, Malaysia and several other nations.<br/>
The Dutch safety board concluded in a report last year that the aircraft was brought down by a Russian-made surface-to-air Buk missile but did not say who fired it.<br/>
Ukraine and western experts have blamed Russian-backed rebels for firing the missile but this has been rejected by Russia, which has blamed Ukrainian forces.<br/>
Mr Skinner, who previously worked on compensation claims lodged by families against Libya following the Lockerbie disaster, said it was clear that without Mr Putin’s permission a Buk missile would never have crossed the border into Ukraine.</p>, <p>“That doesn’t simply happen in Russia unless it is cleared all the way to the top,” he said.<br/>
A Russian spokesman said on Sunday the country did not yet have any information about the compensation claim.<br/>
Last year Russia vetoed a UN resolution that sought to establish an independent tribunal for the purpose of prosecuting people responsible for downing MH17. An investigation by Dutch criminal prosecutors has yet to conclude.<br/>
Moscow’s refusal to back a UN investigation stands in contrast to its pursuit of those responsible for a terrorist attack on an Egyptian jet in October that killed 224 people, mainly Russian holidaymakers. Russia has offered $50m for information leading to the capture of those responsible.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bfd6b496-2098-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.html#axzz49XIm2TkR"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""144""/>

19,Donald Trump leaving neocons in dust,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/donald-trump-leaving-neocons-in-dust/,"[<p>The rise of <span class=""rollover-people"">Donald Trump</span> is threatening the power of neoconservatives, who find themselves at risk of being marginalized in the Republican Party.</p>, <p>Neoconservatism was at its height during the presidency of George W. Bush, helping to shape the rationale for the U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p>, <p>But now the ideology is under attack, with Trump systematically rejecting each of its core principles.</p>, <p>Whereas neoconservatism advocates spreading American ideals through the use of military force, Trump has made the case for nationalism and a smaller U.S. military footprint.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In what Trump calls an “America First” approach, he proposes rejecting alliances that don’t work, trade deals that don’t deliver, and military interventionism that costs too much.</p>, <p>He has said he would get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sit down with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un — a throwback to the “realist” foreign policy of President Nixon.</p>, <p>As if to underscore that point, the presumptive GOP nominee met with Nixon’s Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, earlier this week, and delivered his first major foreign policy speech at an event last month hosted by the Center for National Interest, which Nixon founded.</p>, <p>Leading neoconservative figures like Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan have assailed Trump’s foreign policy views. Kagan even called Trump a “fascist” in a recent Washington Post op-ed.</p>, <p>“This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac ‘tapping into’ popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party — out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear — falling into line behind him,” wrote Kagan, who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>, <p>Other neoconservatives say Trump’s foreign policy stances, such as his opposition to the Iraq war and the U.S. intervention in Libya, are inconsistent and represent “completely mindless” boasting.</p>, <p>“It’s not, ‘Oh I really feel that the neoconservatism has come to a bad end and we need to hearken back to the realism of the Nixon administration,’ ” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>, <p>“Do you see anybody who voted for Donald Trump saying that? Absolutely not,” she said. “I don’t think Donald Trump believes in anything but Donald Trump, and that’s why the right label for his movement is Trumpism — nothing else.”</p>, <p>Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, agreed, saying that to associate Trump to such a clear school of thought as realism “would be being a little bit generous.”</p>, <p>“[Neoconservatives] are concerned for good reason,” said O’Hanlon, a Democratic defense hawk “These people don’t think that Trump is prepared intellectually to be president.”</p>, <p>“It’s not just that their stance of foreign policy would be losing .. .all foreign policy schools would be losing influence under Trump with very unpredictable consequences,” he added.</p>, <p>Despite the opposition he faces in some corners of the GOP, polls indicate that Trump’s message is in line with the public mood.</p>, <p>A recent Pew poll found that nearly six in 10 Americans said the U.S. should “deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their own problems as best they can,” a more isolationist approach at odds with neoconservative thought.</p>, <p>John Mearsheimer, a preeminent scholar in realist theory, says there’s a parallel in history to the way America turned inward after the Vietnam War.</p>, <p>“There’s no question that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger went a considerable ways to pursue a less ambitious foreign policy, and they talked about allies doing more to help themselves, and they began to pursue detente with the Soviet Union.”</p>, <p>“And this was all a reaction to Vietnam. Vietnam of course was a colossal failure. The body politic here in the United States was deeply disenchanted with American foreign policy, especially in its most ambitious forms and the end result is we ended up backing off for awhile,” he said. “We have a similar situation here.”</p>, <p>Experts say the isolationist sentiment is prevalent in the Democratic Party as well.</p>, <p>“The [Bernie] Sanders supporters charge <span class=""rollover-people"">Hillary Clinton</span> with never seeing a quagmire she did not wish to enter, and basically with not just complicity, but a leading role in contriving some of the worst disasters of American foreign policy in this century,” said Amb. Chas Freeman, a senior fellow at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and a former Nixon and George H.W. Bush official.</p>, <p>“This is the principle reason that Hillary Clinton is having so much trouble putting <span class=""rollover-people"">Bernie Sanders</span>away,” said Mearsheimer, who supports the Vermont senator. “Sanders is capitalizing on all that disenchantment in the public, and Hillary Clinton represents the old order.”</p>, <p>But the ideological battle over foreign policy is playing out more forcefully in the GOP.</p>, <p>While some members of the Republican foreign policy establishment are coming to terms with Trump becoming their party’s nominee, including lawmakers like Sens. <span class=""rollover-people"">John McCain</span> (R-Ariz.) and<span class=""rollover-people"">Lindsey Graham</span> (R-S.C.), neoconservatives remain staunch holdouts.</p>, <p>Some experts say neoconservatives are fighting hard because they have the most to lose.</p>, <p>“They’re losing influence inside the foreign policy establishment in general, and they have definitely lost influence inside the Republican party, which was their home base,” Mearsheimer said.</p>, <p>Some neoconservatives are even throwing in their lot with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, most prominently Kagan and Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>, <p>With Republican foreign policy figures split, influential Republican donors such as Charles and David Koch are trying to shape the GOP’s new direction.</p>, <p>The Charles Koch Institute recently launched a daylong conference that featured Mearsheimer and another prominent realist Stephen Walt that questioned U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War.</p>, <p>“This has meant the frequent use of force, a military budget the size of the next seven to eight countries combined, and an active policy of spreading American power and values,” said William Ruger, vice president of research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute.</p>, <p>“After a quarter century of this approach, it’s time to ask: Has our foreign policy been working? Is it making America safe? Should we continue on this path?

20,Sanders calls on Democrats to oppose to debt bill of Puerto Rico,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/sanders-calls-on-democrats-to-oppose-to-debt-bill-of-puerto-rico/,"[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is calling on Senate Democrats to oppose a bipartisan bill aimed at defusing Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, breaking with the White House and his rival in the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton.</p>, <p>The Vermont senator said Monday the bill “would make a terrible situation even worse,” citing a control board that the legislation would establish for the territory.<br/>
“We must stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the American citizens of Puerto Rico with the respect and dignity that they deserve,” Sanders wrote in a Monday letter to Senate Democrats.<br/>
Puerto Rico will be holding its Democratic presidential primary on June 5.</p>, <p>Sanders said he objects to the board’s power to override the territorial government. The most recent version of the bill arms a seven-person fiscal oversight board with substantial power. The board can override any territorial government act it deems to violate the bill, request audited financial statements, subpoena witnesses and impose criminal penalities.</p>, <p>“We must never give an unelected control board the power to make life and death decisions for the people of Puerto Rico without any meaninigful input from them at all,” Sanders wrote.</p>, <p>Sanders announced his opposition to the new Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act on Thursday.</p>, <p>An updated version of the debt bill was introduced last Wednesday. Along with Clinton and the White House, the legislation is supported by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).</p>, <p>Other notable progressives shared Sanders’s concerns about the control board, but still supported the bill.</p>, <p>“This is not the bill I would write. … This legislation is a compromise, so of course there are aspects that cause me concern,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee–the panel handling the bill–and co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “But I am even more concerned about the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the island.”</p>, <p>Reps. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) and José Serrano (D-N.Y.), both Puerto Rican themselves, also supported the bill.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/finance/280890-sanders-calls-on-senate-dems-to-oppose-puerto-rico-bill"">Source</a><br/>

21,Hillary to Trump: ‘How can anybody lose money running a casino?’,World News From Politics,24 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/24/hillary-to-trump-how-can-anybody-lose-money-running-a-casino/,"[<p>Hillary Clinton got more personal with Donald Trump on Monday, poking the presumptive Republican nominee for his businesses’ four bankruptcies, including his failed casinos.<br/>
“What little we know of his economic policies would be running up our debt, starting trade wars, letting Wall Street run wild, all of that could cause another crash and devastate working families and our country,” the Democratic candidate told an audience at the Service Employees International Union’s annual convention in Detroit. “Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt. He could bankrupt America like he’s bankrupted his companies. I mean, ask yourself, how can anybody lose money running a casino? Really. ”</p>, <p>Clinton remarked that she hears from families “every day” about what a Trump presidency would mean for immigrants living and working in the United States, particularly those in mixed-status families where children were born in the country but parents are perhaps undocumented. “We’re talking about real people,” Clinton said.</p>, <p>“He’s talking about sending a deportation force to schools, workplaces and homes to round up moms, dads, grandparents, even children. When he talks about ending birthright citizenship, he’s talking about kicking children who are born here out of the only country they know,” she said, referring to Trump’s remarks in an interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last November.</p>, <p>Laying out the stakes for the general election, Clinton warned, “The only thing standing between Donald Trump and the Oval Office is all of us.”<br/>
Clinton alternately praised Bernie Sanders for the campaign he has run but also vowed to unify the Democratic Party “and stop Donald Trump.”<br/>
Wrapping up her speech, Clinton laid out another turn of phrase calling out Trump for his rhetoric.<br/>
“We need a president who will use the bully pulpit to stand up for working families, but the last thing we need is a bully in the pulpit,” she said. “And nobody knows better than a union like SEIU that the only way to stand up to a bully is to stand up together.”</p>, <p>Trump senior adviser Ed Brookover defended the billionaire businessman’s record in an interview with CNN, highlighting Trump as a job creator while casting Clinton as a heavy regulator and taxer.<br/>
“I think that Mrs. Clinton has a lot to learn about how American businesses work,” he said. “She overregulates, she overtaxes, she overpromises and doesn’t deliver. Mr. Trump has a long history of creating jobs, of creating wealth in this country, and if Mr. Trump gets to the White House he’ll be able to take that business expertise and apply it to America.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-casinos-bankrupt-223486"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.magazinapro.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""129""/>

22,Fans of Sanders plan rallies near Dem convention,World News From Politics,21 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/21/fans-of-sanders-plan-rallies-near-dem-convention/,"[<p>Bernie Sanders’s supporters have secured permits for four demonstrations near July’s Democratic National Convention, according to a new report.</p>, <p>The events will rally support for Sanders’s message while Democrats select their presidential nominee in Philadelphia, according to The Wall Street Journal.<br/>
The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that one permit authorizes an event consisting of four days of all-day rallies at FDR Park.<br/>
Philadelphia expects at least 30,000 participants; organizers are hoping the turnout is even higher. The park is located close to the Wells Fargo Center, putting it in close proximity to the convention’s epicenter.</p>, <p>The Wall Street Journal said that the other three events are scheduled for Thomas Paine Plaza, which is located a few miles from the convention’s venue. Philadelphia expects around 2,000 to 3,000 fans demonstrating for the independent Vermont senator at those events.</p>, <p>“The whole Bernie movement is an ideology,” said Steve Okan Layne, who is helping organize one of the rallies. “If Bernie wins the nomination, wins the presidency, that would be amazing.”</p>, <p>Nevada’s Democratic convention burst into chaos last weekend when Sanders supporters loudly protested the results and booed Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).</p>, <p>The Nevada State Democratic Party on Monday warned that Sanders’s backers may instigate “actual violence” the Democratic National Convention this summer.</p>, <p>Bill Taylor, another organizer for July’s events in Philadelphia, on Friday said that planners are working closely with the city to prevent similar disruptions.</p>, <p>“We are marching,” he said. “If you’re planning on coming here with violence in mind, we don’t want you.”</p>, <p>The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that all four events are independent of Sanders’s presidential campaign.</p>, <p>Sanders has repeatedly vowed he will fight Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, every step until July’s convention.</p>, <p>Clinton leads Sanders in total delegates nationwide, having 2,293 to his 1,533, including the unbound superdelegates who vote at the convention. That leaves her needing just 89 more to clinch the nomination with 2,382 delegates.</p>, <p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280690-sanders-fans-plan-rallies-near-dem-convention"">Source</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.seattletimes.com/"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""125""/>

23,Sanders camp slams Debbie Wasserman Schultz for ‘throwing shade’,World News From Politics,18 May,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/05/18/sanders-camp-slams-debbie-wasserman-schultz-for-throwing-shade/,"[<p>Bernie Sanders’ campaign fired back at Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday after the Democratic National Committee chairwoman panned the campaign’s <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/wasserman-schultz-sanders-223304"" target=""_blank"">“anything but acceptable”</a> response to reports of violence at the Nevada Democratic convention over the weekend.</p>, <p>The Nevada Democratic Party lodged a <a href=""http://static.politico.com/ae/c9/f483b5a04e278e40890e95ebbb33/160516-letter-dnc-rbc-nvdemsconvention-final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">formal complaint</a> to co-chairs and members of the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee on Tuesday over the conduct of Sanders supporters and representatives of his campaign at the convention. The state party warned that the “very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats” is indicative of what could happen in Philadelphia in July.</p>, <p>Sanders released a statement before the convention and again after speaking with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday.</p>, <p>“He categorically condemns any kind of threats that went on — absolutely unacceptable,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN before accusing Wasserman Schultz of “throwing shade on the Sanders campaign since the very beginning,” citing a limited debate schedule that featured weekend debates, the campaign’s revoked access to its voter data and a joint fundraising agreement with Hillary Clinton’s campaign that Weaver said takes money away from state parties and goes to the DNC.</p>, <p>“Look, I gotta say it’s not the DNC,” Weaver added. “You know, by and large, people at the DNC have been very good to us. Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exception.”</p>, <p>In a <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/nevada-democratic-convention-wasserman-schultz-223271"" target=""_blank"">statement</a> Tuesday, Sanders condemned “any and all forms of violence” but noted that months ago shots were fired into his campaign office and a housing complex his campaign staffed lived in “was broken into and ransacked.”</p>, <p>“If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,” he said.</p>, <p>Appearing on CNN on Wednesday morning, Wasserman Schultz said Sanders’ statement wasn’t good enough. “With all due respect, when there is a ‘but’ in between condemnation of violence generally, and after the word ‘but’ you go on to seemingly justify the reason that the violence and intimidation has occurred, then that falls short of making sure that going forward this kind of conduct doesn’t occur in the future,” she said.</p>, <p>In his appearance on MSNBC, Weaver said Wasserman Schultz’s remark was “ridiculous.”</p>, <p>“It’s been pretty clear almost from the get-go that she has been working against Bernie Sanders — I mean, there’s no doubt about it — for personal reasons,” he said, again ticking through the criticisms he launched earlier but this time adding that the chairwoman “appointed really hostile Hillary Clinton partisans” to head standing committees, too.</p>, <p>“Debbie Wasserman Schultz has really been the divider and not really provided the kind of leadership that the Democratic Party needs,” he said.</p>, <p>Weaver said he speaks with high-ranking Democrats at the DNC with frequency but suggested there isn’t consensus “in terms of her tactics,” calling the revoked voter data access a “unilateral” decision from Wasserman Schultz.</p>, <p>“Believe me, there was tremendous pressure inside the party structure for her to relent,” Weaver said. “I don’t really know what her motivation is, but it’s been clear there’s a pattern of conduct from the beginning of this campaign that has been hostile to Bernie Sanders and his supporters and she’s really become a divisive figure in the party.”</p>, <p>Wasserman Schultz maintained that the rules are “eminently fair,” arguing that the current set of rules are the same regulations that resulted in Barack Obama’s nomination.</p>, <p>“But regardless, it is critical that we as candidates, we as Democratic Party leaders, everyone involved needs to make sure that we can take all the steps that we need to, to ensure that the process is not only run smoothly but that the response from the supporters of both candidates is appropriate and civil,” she said. “No one should be subjected to death threats.”</p>, <p>Tuesday’s letter from the Nevada Democratic Party alleged that Sanders supporters posted state Chairwoman Roberta Lange’s personal information online and threatened her and her family.</p>, <p>Wasserman Schultz said Lange “has been essentially stalked by phone, has had to endure unacceptable feedback through violence and intimidation” and called it her responsibility as DNC chair to ensure candidates and everyone involved understand the appropriate way to respond to frustration over process is with civility.</p>, <p>Despite the indirect back and forth, both parties expressed confidence that the Democratic Party can unite behind the eventual nominee, with Weaver, who reiterated that Sanders will support the nominee and do whatever he can to prevent a Donald Trump presidency, calling what happened in Nevada a “Nevada-centric issue.”</p>, <p>“Let’s not confuse what went on in Nevada with some kind of broader issue,” Weaver said. “We’ve had great relationships with state parties all across this country and continue to.”</p>, <p>Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon credited Sanders for condemning the violence and encouraged people not to read too much into what transpired in Nevada.</p>, <p>“There’s been state party conventions happening quietly without much notice across the country,” Fallon told CNN. “This was really the exception, not the rule. So we don’t think it’s a harbinger for Philadelphia.”</p>, <p class=""story-continued""><a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz-criticism-223318"">Source</a></p>, <p class=""story-continued""><a href=""http://www.politico.com"">Image Source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""122""/>

I sense some great victories coming.”</p>, <p>“I sense some great victories coming, and I think while the path is narrow — and I do not deny that for a moment — I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States and in fact become the nominee for the Democratic Party,” he continued. “And once we secure that position, I have absolute confidence that we are gonna defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”</p>, <p>The Indiana Democratic primary was too close to call once all the polls closed at 7 p.m. EDT. The contest was neck and neck, but Sanders later pulled ahead of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.</p>, <p>As of 11 p.m., Sanders led 52 percent to 48 percent, with 95 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press.</p>, <p>Sanders said he believes he’s the best candidate to take on Trump in November.

Sanders would need to win every remaining pledged delegate and sway more superdelegates to his side to reach that threshold.</p>, <p>On Tuesday night, Sanders said he will continue to “make the case” to the superdelegates that reside in states where he claimed resounding victories.</p>, <p>“I believe we’ll be able to make the case to many of those superdelegates that what is most important is whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the nominee,” Sanders said. “What is most important is that we do not allow someone like a Donald Trump to become president of the United States.”</p>, <p>Source : www.thehill.com</p>, <p>Image <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com"">source</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""111""/>

The <a href=""http://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders""><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a> campaign is complaining, Sanders argues the fundraising raises “serious apparent violations” of the campaign finance laws, and that they should “cease immediately.”</p>, <p>The letter said the Hillary Victory Fund reported receiving individual contributions as high at $353,400 or more, “which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton’s campaign.”</p>, <p>“Bernie 2016 is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising, Deutsch said in the letter that the issue has “grown to staggering magnitudes” and “can no longer be ignored.”<br/>
“At worst, using funds received from large-dollar donors who have already contributed the $2,700 maximum to HFA [Hillary for America] may represent an excessive contribution to HFA from these individuals.”</p>, <p>It also says that the joint committee paid the Clinton campaign committee $2.6 million to “reimburse” members of Clinton’s presidential campaign for time running the joint committee.</p>, <p>“While the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time — it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, in a news release.</p>, <p><em><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/276702-sanders-lawyer-clinton-dnc-joint-fundraising-raises"">Source </a></em></p>, <p><em><a href=""http://m.reddit.com"">Image source</a></em></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""106""/>

Bernie Sanders urged caution Monday against interpreting polls showing him trailing Hillary Clinton in New York. His argument: We’ve been here before.</p>, <p>“Those are the public polls. The bottom line is, let’s look at the real poll tomorrow,” the Vermont senator told NBC’s “Today.” “Generally speaking, polling has underestimated how we do in elections.”</p>, <p>Sanders noted that his campaign was down by as many as 25 points in Michigan before it pulled off the upset victory on March 8.</p>, <p>According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls of likely voters in New York’s April 19 Democratic primary, Clinton leads Sanders by nearly 13 percentage points, and there’s no sign that he’s closing the gap.</p>, <p>“The main point is, I think, we have a message that’s resonating all over this country,” Sanders said. “We have enthusiasm. We have energy. People understand it’s too late for establishment politics and economics. They want real change in the country. They want leadership to stand up to the billionaire class. That’s what we are providing.”</p>, <p>Sanders also reiterated his support for legislation that would allow United States courts to determine if foreign countries or entities are responsible for the 9/11 attacks, such as Saudi Arabia, and subsequently permit the families of the victims to sue the Saudi government. While acknowledging the current administration’s concern that such action could open Americans to legal action from other national entities, Sanders stressed the importance of a full investigation, as well as the release of classified information related to the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>, <p>“We also asked for the release of that information. As you may know, the Saudi government has been a major proponent of Wahhabism, which is an an extreme fundamentalist version of Islam. Which is being taught all over the world,” Sanders said. “It is a very destructive religion. I think it’s important we do understand the role that the Saudis may have played.<br/>

28,New poll: Female voters flock to Bernie Sanders from Hillary Clinton,World News From Politics,16 Apr,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/04/16/new-poll-female-voters-flock-to-bernie-sanders-from-hillary-clinton/,"[<p>Bernie Sanders pulled within two points of Hillary Clinton in a stunning new national poll and brought his progressive message to the Vatican just hours after dominating a brawling Brooklyn debate.</p>, <p>Sanders closed a 13-point gap in a Fox News Channel poll last month to just two points, 48-46 percent. The boost came from female voters, a longtime Clinton stronghold. The former secretary of state’s support among women dropped by 11 points, while Sanders’ showing jumped by 9 points.</p>, <p>Sanders still trails Clinton by ranges of 10 to 15 points in the polls in New York. And although the latest polls don’t factor in any gains from Thursday’s debate, Sanders faces an uphill battle to score big in the Empire State. But analysts say the Vermont U.S. senator can spin the primary into a victory if he closes the gap, but he would still face a daunting delegate deficit.</p>, <p>“At a minimum, he would have to get it down to single digits,” said Chris Galdieri, a political science professor at St. Anselm College.</p>, <p>“Even then … Clinton increases her lead and because New York has so many delegates, it’ll basically probably wipe out whatever ground Sanders gained in recent wins,” Galdieri said.</p>, <p>Sanders yesterday addressed a Vatican conference on income inequality. He had hoped to meet with Pope Francis — a photo op that would have been political gold — but the invitation alone is an important step forward for his candidacy, said Galdieri.</p>, <p>“I think it just gives his campaign additional stature, additional legitimacy,” Galdieri said. “It’s a sign he’s tapped into something that is not going to end with his campaign.”</p>, <p>Both candidates were breaking from the New York campaign trail yesterday, but for very different reasons.</p>, <p>Clinton flew to California to headline a pair of fundraisers with Hollywood superstar George Clooney. One event last night, hosted by venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar, required a couple to raise or donate $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund to land two seats at the head table with Clinton, Clooney and his wife, Amal, according to Politico.</p>, <p>Another fundraiser set for tonight will take place at the Clooney mansion with tickets to dine at their table running $33,400 per person.</p>, <p>The Sanders campaign pounced on the sky-high ticket prices, releasing an ad to run in California over the weekend with supporters urging voters to donate $27 to bolster his campaign.</p>, <p>Source Article :<a href=""http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/2016/04/new_poll_female_voters_flock_to_bernie_sanders_from_hillary_clinton""> www.bostonherald.com</a></p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""98""/>

29,Hillary Clinton Earned More from One Speech Than Bernie Sanders Did in One Year,World News From Politics,16 Apr,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/04/16/hillary-clinton-earned-more-from-one-speech-than-bernie-sanders-did-in-one-year/,"[<p>Bernie Sanders released his 2014 tax returns today, highlighting the disparity of wealth between the Vermont senator and his opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>, <p>In 2014, Sen. Sanders’ household earned <a href=""http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/presreturns.nsf/Returns/9900B87E8AE6AF0C85257EB4004E9F66/$file/B_Sanders_2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">$205,617</a> in income, mostly from his U.S. Senate salary and Social Security payments he and his wife, Jane, received that year. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Sanders’ 2015 tax returns will be filed Monday, and returns from other years may be published as well.</p>, <p>While $200,000 a year puts Bernie Sanders in the top quintile of earners, it still pales in comparison to what Hillary Clinton made by giving 45 paid speeches that year. In fact, the former Secretary of State made more than Sanders’ total annual income in a single speech — she did so several times, in fact. The Hill reports that <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/276520-report-sanders-earned-less-in-a-year-than-clinton-in-one"" target=""_blank"">in 2014</a>, Clinton was paid $280,000 for a speech to Deutsche Bank AG, $325,000 for a speech to the National Automobile Dealers’ Association, and $225,000 for a speaking gig with General Electric.</p>, <p>Paid speaking engagements netted Hillary and Bill Clinton a <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/"" target=""_blank"">combined $153 million</a> from 729 total speeches between the time the Clintons left the White House and May of 2015. The average payment for each speaking gig was $210,795, and 39 of those paid speeches between the two were for the financial sector, for a combined total of $7.7 million.</p>, <p>The contents of Hillary Clinton’s three speeches to Goldman Sachs, for which she was paid a total sum of $675,000, have yet to be released to the public. Sen. Sanders has made Clinton’s refusal to publish the contents of those speeches a key attack point.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi came in third with 2.2 per cent votes followed by US President Barack Obama with two per cent.Time’s editors will announce the ‘TIME 100’, the annual list of the world’s most influential people next week.</p>, <p>While its editors will determine the ultimate honorees, the publication had asked readers to vote from among 127 “world leaders, great minds in science and technology, outstanding figures in the arts and other icons of the moment” on who they think deserve recognition.Pakistani activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Michelle Obama, Pope Francis and Leonardo DiCaprio round out the top 10.</p>, <p>“While (Sanders) badly lags Clinton in winning the delegates needed to capture the presidential nomination, his populist rhetoric and emphasis on income inequality has allowed him to sustain a stronger-than-expected challenge to Clinton while also helping frame the debate in the Democratic contest,” the magazine said.</p>, <p>India-born CEOs of the world’s top technology companies are also among the list of 127 probables for the annual honour.

33,CLINTON AND OBAMA ARE SETTING UP TRUMP’S WIN OF THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION,World News From Politics,29 Jan,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/01/29/clinton-and-obama-are-setting-up-trumps-win-of-the-republican-nomination/,"[<p>Hilary Clinton and America’s president, Barack Obama, have increased attacks on the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, giving accusations that he is manipulating the voter’s “fear and ignorance”, adding that he is using anti-Muslim oratory that in return helps attract Islamic state terrorists, who seem to energize his supporters and strengthen his campaign.</p>, <p>However, the campaign strategists say that these attacks are not meant to take Trump down. They are instead, a very smart and premeditated plan by the democrats, who only want his win because they are sure the billionaire will lose the general elections.</p>, <p>“It definitely makes my allegiance to Donald Trump much greater,” declared  Jeff Moorman, a supporter of Trump’s campaign in Iowa, upon hearing these accusations.</p>, <p>Republican campaign consultant, Ryan Williams, said this was precisely the feedback Democrats are going for.</p>, <p>“It is a calculated effort on the Democrats’ part to elevate Trump. They clearly want Trump to be the nominee because they think they can beat him easily,” Mr. Williams claimed, who has been working on the campaign of Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.</p>, <p>“Attacks from Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama do nothing but energize Donald Trump’s supporters, and I suspect both Clinton and Obama are smart enough to realize that,” he said.</p>, <p>In a head-to-head match-up, the RealClearPolitics average of national polls show Hillary beat Trump by an average of 6 percentage points, which is considerably higher that other Republican candidates, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who come behind Mrs. Clinton by 1.5 and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. All the rest of the Republican runners are better in the match-ups with Clinton in the average of the national polls.</p>, <p>All the way through the campaign, Trump has been a target for Democrats’ attacks. However, the attacks have gone harsher as he confronted the expectations that his avant-garde campaign would fade out and managed to remain on top of most polls.</p>, <p>A national spokesperson for the Tea Party Express, Taylor Budowich, has doubts that Obama and Clinton were in fact trying to fire up conservative voters. He also said that this plan is most likely to backfire, sending a surge of Republican voters to the polls.</p>, <p>“Sometimes a lot of these political consultants and political strategists get too smart for their own good,” he explained. “In trying to control the outcome of an election, they end up getting the exact opposite outcome than what they wanted.”</p>, <p>Hilary Clinton, the Democratic runner and the odds-on favorite of winning nomination, continuously struck Trump during a debate of Democratic candidates on Saturday, claiming that his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. “fans the flames of radicalization.”</p>, <p>“He is becoming ISIS’ best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists,” said Hilary at the debate in New Hampshire.</p>, <p>Donald Trump has requested an apology during an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Monday.</p>, <p>“I will demand an apology from Hillary. She should apologize,” he said. “She lies about emails, she lies about Whitewater, she lies about everything. She will be a disaster as president of the United States.”</p>, <p>Trump added that the claims that he was being used in videos made in the Islamic State, i.e. ISIS, were nothing but another invention from the former State Secretary.</p>, <p>“You’re talking about people dying. You’re talking about making up tapes and videos which don’t exist,” he explained.</p>, <p>A detailed search for ISIS videos and online posts did not provide evidence that Trump was being used as a recruitment tool. According to this, the fact-checking organization Politifact labeled Clinton’s statement as “false”.</p>, <p>Even upon this, an apology was not in order, according to Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesperson.</p>, <p>“Hillary Clinton will not be apologizing to Donald Trump for correctly pointing out how his hateful rhetoric only helps ISIS recruit more terrorists,” he said.</p>, <p>In the meantime, Obama made a remark at Trump and all of those who support him.</p>, <p>He stated that Trump was taking advantage of the “anger, frustration, fear” of the blue-collar men who feel endangered by the rise of multiculturalism and an economy based on technology.</p>, <p>“I think somebody like Mr. Trump is taking advantage of that. That’s what he’s exploiting during the course of his campaign,” said Obama in an interview with NPR.</p>, <p>The president made a critical remark at Trump and his supporters in a fundraising email for the Democratic National Committee.</p>, <p>In this email, Obama claimed that because of his unusual name and his race, he became accustomed to questioning about his religion, place of birth and “even whether I love this country.”</p>, <p>“I always dismissed that kind of talk, but I’ve also learned to listen closely when a conversation starts to lean on fear and ignorance,” he wrote. “So I pay attention when I hear the Republican front-runner for president call for a ban on Muslims entering this country. And when their other candidates say we should only admit Christian refugees, not Muslims, or that there should be a religious test to determine which people fleeing a war-torn country can enter ours.”</p>, <p>Williams said the attacks that are pushing Trump’s conservative supporters are at the same time motivating liberals to open their wallets.</p>, <p>“Trump, for better or worse, is the kind of candidate who elicits reactions on both sides,” Williams added. “People can use a lightning rod like Trump in politics to their advantage to accomplish what they are looking for.”</p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""43""/>

By the end of the previous month, two Democratic officials from Indiana were arrested and convicted of ballot fraud. It seems Obama indeed was not eligible to be on the ballot.</p>, <p>Namely, Chairman Butch Morgan Jr. from St. Joseph County got convicted of felony conspiracy in order to commit petition fraud snd forgery. In addition, Dustin Blyth, who served on the Board of Elections, was also convicted of felony, forgery, and several attempts to make a false petition. These two men were charged and convicted for giving false names and signatures on petitions, created to get both Obama and Hilary Clinton  onto the 2008 primary ballots. It seems as if Morgan had been the driver of the activities.</p>, <p>The Sherrifs of the county have found out that although many St. Joseph county locals claimed they never signed the petition, their names were mentioned in it.</p>, <p>Sadly, the court did not see the case until 2011, when a Board of Registration member, Lucas Burkett, had decided that he couldn’t bear the secret no more.

38,‘I HAVEN’T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE KILLED ANYBODY’ – TRUMP DEFENDS PUTIN,World News From Politics,29 Jan,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/01/29/i-havent-seen-any-evidence-that-he-killed-anybody-trump-defends-putin/,"[<p><strong>George Stephanopoulos, ABC anchor, continually confronted business mogul Donald Trump on Sunday over his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.</strong><br/>
Compliments were traded between Trump and Putin, with the Russian President calling Trump a “very talented” person. Trump’s response to this praise was that it was a “great honor”.<br/>
Following MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough’s steps, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about Putin’s status as a strongman, including accusations that the Kremlin has been involved in orchestrating the deaths of political opponents and journalists.<br/>
What Stephanopoulos specifically pressed Trump on were the comments he gave on Friday in “Morning Joe”, saying that “our country does a lot of killing, also.”<br/>
“What killing sanctioned by the US government is like killing journalists?” Stephanopoulos asked.<br/>
Trump then answered that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton killed “thousands and thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of people” with her allegedly “horrible, horrible decisions.”<br/>
“That’s not killing by the United States government though. That’s not the same —” Stephanopoulos continued.<br/>
Trump then went on that there was no proof that Putin or his government have taken part in the killing of reporters.</p>, <p>“As far as the reporters are concerned, obviously, I don’t want that to happen. I think it’s horrible,” Trump said.<br/>
“But, in all fairness to Putin, you’re saying he killed people. I haven’t seen that,” Trump added. “I don’t know that he has. And you’ve been able to prove that you know the names of the reporters that he’s killed? Because you’ve been hearing this, but I haven’t seen the names. Now, I think it would be despicable if that took place. But I haven’t seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.”</p>, <p>Stephanopoulos then referred to a tweet from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, when he indicated what he brought up as “important distinction” between killings by Russia and the US.<br/>
“Does he know for a fact that he kills the reporters?” Trump asked about Romney. “I don’t think anybody knows that. It’s possible that he does, but I don’t think it’s been proven. Yeah, sure, there are allegations. … But nobody’s proven he’s killed anybody.”.<br/>
He continued: “If he has killed reporters, I think that’s terrible. But this isn’t like somebody that stood with a gun and is taking the blame or is admitting that he’s killed. He’s always denied it. It’s never been proven that he’s killed anybody. So you’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country.”<br/>
“Your comments seemed to suggest a moral equivalence between the United States and Russia. Is that what you believe?” Stephanopoulos was quick to shoot back.<br/>
“I’m not saying anything,” Trump replied.” I’m saying, when you say a man has killed reporters, I’d like you to prove it. And I’m saying it would be a terrible thing if it were true. But I’ve never seen any information or any proof that he killed reporters, George.”<br/>
He added: “You’re making these accusations, and I don’t see any proof. And by the way, he totally denies that he kills reporters.”<br/>
As the Committee to Protect Journalists states, 56 journalists have been killed in Russia since 1992, including at least 23 since Putin became president in 2000. However, not all of the deaths appear to be related to the work of journalists.</p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""26""/>

40,BREAKING: PUTIN ORDERS NUCLEAR FORCES TO HIGHEST ALERT AFTER OBAMA MOVES CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO SYRIA,World News From Politics,29 Jan,http://worldnewsfrompolitics.com/2016/01/29/breaking-putin-orders-nuclear-forces-to-highest-alert-after-obama-moves-chemical-weapons-to-syria/,"[<p>According to the MoD, prompting President Putin’s activities were intelligence reports gotten from the Levant War Zone overnight documenting that the high level United States chemical weapons troops belonging to the US Army’s Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (<a href=""http://chemdef.apgea.army.mil/"" target=""_blank"">USAMRICD</a>) and Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (<a href=""http://www.ecbc.army.mil/"" target=""_blank"">ECBC</a>) were landed overnight at the Rmeilan airfield throughout Syria’s northern domain of Hasakah near the Turkish border.</p>, <p>According to the report, Putin’s worries were raising because he believes that the US Air Force aircraft landing at the Rmelian airfield has previously made a ‘small’ stop in Kentucky in route to the Levant War Zone where the US has supposedly illegally stockpiled 524 tons of spectrum  of chemical weapons – including the deadly nerve agent Sarin.</p>, <p>The report explains that this “grave escalation” of the conflict could easily escalate into World War III, despite the US and Russia’s “friendly terrorists fighting” relationship in Syria.  The non-stop Aerospace Forces (Russian) bombing and the lost control over the town of Sheikh Miskeen is also being question, as it is located at a crossroads commanding a CIA southern supply route between the Jordanian border and the Syrian capital, Damascus.</p>, <p>In anticipating that their “<i>friendly terrorists</i>” would be utterly defeated at Sheikh Miskeen, the Obama regimes Vice President, Joseph Biden, made an urgent flight to Turkey this past weekend where he warned that the US is ready to impose a military solution in Syria—a threat that is being backed up by their NATO ally Turkey’s massive military buildup along the Syrian border.</p>, <p>The report represents a warning, saying that Obama’s regimes true goal is ultimately destroying Russia – and as articulated by top Security Council (SC) member Nikolai Patrushev who this past week warned:</p>, <p><i>The United States’ leadership has set a goal of global dominance. They don’t need a strong Russia. On the contrary, they need to weaken our country as much as possible. To achieve this goal, the Russian Federation’s disintegration is not ruled out as well. This will open access to the richest resources for the United States, which believes that Russia possesses them undeservingly</i>.</p>, <p>Agreeing with Nikolai Patrushev’s grim assessment of what the Obama regime is actually doing, this report further notes, is the Professor Emeritus University of Arizona, Dr. Guy McPherson, who, likewise, this week warned that the United States is determined to lead Russia toward an escalation of tensions, putting the whole world at risk of a major military conflict.</p>, <p>This week the US Military announced that they will change the way it’s being reported of the civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria, so that it’ll be impossible for anyone to ever know how many there are. This fact is also taken into consideration in this report. It is seen as a big step in Obama’s major plan to unleash “total hell” on this region (and the world).</p>, <p>The one exception to this though, this report concludes, is President Obama’s actual legal authority to unleash World War III upon us all—but which the US Senate has taken a small step toward by making a new law authorizing the use of American military force against the Islamic State, but whose leaders said yesterday they <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/26/senate-lobs-islamic-state-war-authority-back-obama-seeking-fewer-limits/79353428/"" target=""_blank"">will not actually pass legislation unless President Obama agrees not to limit where US troops can fight, how long the battle will last or whether ground troops can be used</a>—in other words, Russia is up next.</p>, <p>Source: <a href=""http://www.eutimes.net/2016/01/putin-orders-nuclear-forces-to-highest-alert-after-obama-moves-chemical-weapons-to-syria/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheEuropeanUnionTimes+%28The+European+Union+Times%29"" target=""_blank"">The European Union Times</a></p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""author__bio"" itemprop=""description""></p>, <p class=""comment-form-comment""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""comment"">Comment</label><textarea aria-required=""true"" cols=""45"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" placeholder=""Message"" rows=""8""></textarea></p>, <p class=""comment-form-author""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""author"">Name</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""author"" name=""author"" placeholder=""Name..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-email""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""name"">Email</label><input aria-required=""true"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""comment-form-url""><label class=""show-on-ie8"" for=""url"">Url</label><input id=""url"" name=""url"" placeholder=""Website..."" size=""30"" type=""text""/></p>, <p class=""form-submit""><input class=""submit"" id=""comment-submit"" name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Send""/> <input id=""comment_post_ID"" name=""comment_post_ID"" type=""hidden"" value=""17""/>
