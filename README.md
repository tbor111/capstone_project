# capstone_project
This is work for my capstone project as part of the requirements for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course.

The goal of this project is to develop a library to manage news data with the goal of constructing a classifier that can identify the correct category of an article. More information can be found at [my blog](teresaborcuch.github.io/capstone)
